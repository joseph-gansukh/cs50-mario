Recreated those pyramids in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, as below. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramids themselves are also be taller than they are wide.

```

```

The program let's user to decide how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive. Below is how the program should work if the user inputs 8: 

```
$ ./mario-1
